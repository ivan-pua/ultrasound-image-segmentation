# Segmentation and Registration of Ultrasound Scans

**Aim**: Performs image processing of the ultrasound scans of the spinal cord, which allows a 3D Model of the spinal cord to be simulated

This repo has 3 parts:
* Segmentation of ultrasound images through dynamic programming. <em>This is still a work in progress.</em>
* Registration of segmented model with the ground truth model (spine)
* Registration of segmented model with the ground truth model (simple geometry)
